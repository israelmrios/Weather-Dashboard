# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather application that uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve current and future weather forecast and dynamically displays it on the page. The application will allow you to enter over 200,000 different cities and gill give you the current temperature, wind speed, humidity level and UV index. It will also give you the same information for the following five days. This project really allowed me to work with Bootstrap and JavaScript, I really enjoyed creating elements and adding classes in JavaScript and then seeing them come to life in the page.

## Instructions
